The goal of score4cast is to provide a convenient interface to score ecological forecasts that conform the EFI standard. 
score4cast emphasizes the use of strictly proper scores (see [scoringRules]() R package or Gneiting & Raferty's landmark 2007 paper) for _probablistic_ forecasts.
The EFI format provides a simple but flexible way to express both ensemble and parametric forecasts in a standard tabular layout. 


## Installation

You can install the development version of score4cast from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("eco4cast/score4cast")
```

## Example

A forecast (in standardized format) is scored against a target (in standardized format):


```{r example}
library(score4cast)
ex_data <- system.file("extdata/standard-format-examples.R", package="score4cast")
source(ex_data)

scores <- score(ex_forecast, ex_target)
scores
```
